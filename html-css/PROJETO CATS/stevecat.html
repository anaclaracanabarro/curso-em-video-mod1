  <p>If you are <strong>Steve</strong>, you are a lovely person, always willing to help and you are cool, cuz you farm and unfortunately die everytime. You're explorer and gets lost easily.</p>
  <p>As a good player, you are always doing what it takes to evolve your base and your familycraft. Does <strong>The Builder</strong> need wood? You get it!</p>
  <p>If <strong>The Fighter</strong> needs a new shield, or if his sword broke during battle, only you can help him by teleporting. Just be careful not to end up dying!</p>
  <p>You're a good person and good player. Congratulations!</p>
