  <p>If you are <strong>The Fighter</strong>, you kill all the monsters for the sake of your familycraft. You are the super hero. Also, you are prepared for anything!</p>
  <p>If a member of your familycraft is in danger, you quickly teleport to him with your diamond armor and sword, your shield and your great willpower to protect. You don't shit your pants to any creature, unless he's a... <strong>baby zombie</strong>! Ugh! 
  <p><del>...children being children even in a virtual game...</del> Just kidding haha humor and jokes!!!</p>
  </p>
  <p>You're a good person and good player. Congratulations!</p>
